                Alongside academics, I work as a software development intern, <br>
                where I am sharpening my programming and database management skills. <br> 
                I have a year of experience in C#, primarily working with the .NET Framework, and <br> 
                I am passionate about IoT projects, exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems. <br>
                In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, designing creative dashboards, <br>
                and improving my typing and documentation skills. <br>
                My goal is to grow as a systems engineer, combining technical expertise with practical applications <br>
                to make a meaningful impact. <br>
                and I am currently pursuing my studies in Commerce with a strong focus on accounts. <br>
